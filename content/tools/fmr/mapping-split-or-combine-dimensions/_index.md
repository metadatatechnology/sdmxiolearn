subtitle = "Learn how to SDMX structure mapping and FMR's data mapping function to split out or collapse dimensions for time series data"
description = "Course Introduction"
summary = "A common use case is transforming compound indicators to two or more discrete dimensions to make the dataset easier to query or as a precursor to processing operations. The inverse where multiple dimensions are collapsed into a compound indicator is also used for simplifying datasets with complex internal structures ready for public dissemination. In this module you will learn how to achieve both of these transformations using SDMX Structure Maps and FMR's data transformation services."
