# Split out or collapse dimensions for time series data

## Module introduction
A common use case is transforming compound indicators to two or more discrete dimensions to make the dataset easier to query or as a precursor to processing operations. The inverse where multiple dimensions are collapsed into a compound indicator is also used for simplifying datasets with complex internal structures ready for public dissemination. 

In this module you will learn how to achieve both of these transformations using SDMX Structure Maps and FMR's data transformation services.

## Learning objectives
- SDMX 3.0 structure mapping principles
- Prepare a SDMX Structure Map to transform a dataset splitting a compound indicator into a number of discrete dimensions
- Execute the transformation using FMR's web user interface
- Prepare a SDMX Structure map to simplify the structure of a dataset by collapsing several dimensions into a single compound indicator
