# SDMX data conversion fundamentals using Fusion Metadata Registry

## Module introduction
The SDMX standard provides 12 alternative formats for transmitting data including EDI, JSON, CSV and seven different variants of XML. 

In this module we look at precisely what these formats are, which ones are most useful and how to use Fusion Metadata Registry to convert SDMX datasets between them.

## Learning objectives
- Gain a basic understanding of the common SDMX data transmission formats including the most-used XML formats, JSON, CSV and EDI, plus Fusion Metadata Registry's own Excel format
- How to convert datasets to different transmission formats interactively using the FMR web user interface
- The SDMX-ML 2.1 structure specific 'quick convert' function
- Principles of how to use FMR's data transformation REST API for converting datasets programmatically
