# SDMX data conversion fundamentals using Fusion Metadata Registry

## Module introduction
The SDMX standard provides 12 alternative formats for transmitting data including EDI, JSON, CSV and seven different variants of XML. Enevitably it's a common requirement to convert SDMX datasets between these formats. In this module we look at how to use Fusion Metadata Registry for that purpose.

## Learning objectives
- Attain a basic understanding of the common SDMX data transmission formats including the most-used XML formats, JSON, CSV and EDI, plus Fusion Metadata Registry's own Excel format
- Converting datasets to different transmission formats interactively using the FMR web user interface
- How to use the SDMX-ML 2.1 structure specific 'quick convert' function
- Principles of how to use FMR's data transformation REST API for converting datasets programmatically
