# Getting started with Fusion Metadata Registry - running FMR in Docker

## Module introduction
Welcome to this module on getting started with Fusion Metadata Registry and specifically how to run the software in Docker.

Fusion Metadata Registry (FMR) is a free to use software tool for working with SDMX structures and data. 

You'll need two things to start working effectively with FMR:

- a basic understanding of the SDMX information model; and
- a running installation of the FMR software.

FMR is a Java web application so it will run on a range of computing platforms including Windows, Mac and Linux. However, it requires a number of other software components including a Java runtime environment, a Java web application server and a SQL database service such as MySQL or SQL Server.

Fortunately there is a simpler way to get working in less than 10 minutes - running FMR as a Docker container.

This module will help you learn about what FMR is, the use cases it serves, SDMX information model fundamentals and the how to run FMR in Docker.

## Learning objectives
- Understand what FMR is and its role as a structural metadata registry
- Learn the fundamentals of the SDMX 3.0 information model
- Understand the principles of software 'containerisation' and how Docker can be used for that purpose
- Installation and basic operation of Docker Desktop 
- How to create and run FMR in a container using Docker Desktop
